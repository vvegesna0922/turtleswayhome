Project Name: Turtle’s Way Home 

Project Description:
This project is a game where the main objective is to make the user solve a randomly generated maze before their lives run out. The user will use the arrow keys as controls and will represent a turtle attempting to make its way back home without running into enemies. The enemies include plastic, sharks, and fish. The turtle starts out with 3 lives and collisions with each enemy makes the turtle lose a different number of lives. There will also be a set timer to see how long it takes to for the user to solve the maze and there will a leader board that displays the user with the best time and said time. The plastic will float around the maze randomly but the shark and fish enemies will be using different maze generation algorithms to follow a specific path. Additionally, the fish enemy will only be active and move in certain paths depending on which part of the maze the turtle is currently in. The user will also have access to a store where they can buy additional lives. They will earn the points to buy lives by finishing the maze with additional lives remaining. Each time the game is run, a random maze is generated and each time the users clicks the r key, they can get a newly generated maze. There will also be different levels the user can choose from. The higher the level is, the harder the maze is and the more enemies there are.

How to run the project:
In order to run the app, you have to run the VSCode file. Then in the terminal it will ask you to type in your username. Then you have to choose which level you want to play. Then the game will start and the home screen with instructions will pop up and you can start playing the game. 

Libraries Needed: I did not use any libraries in my project so nothing needs to be installed. 

List of shortcut commands:
If you press the b key, you can go directly to the store. 
If you press the h key, you can go back to the home screen. 
If you press the k key, you can start the game. 
If you press the r key, a new random maze will be generated. 
When you start the game and you press the space bar, your leaderboard file will be erased and you can start fresh. 
If you press s, you will see a green line that is the solution to the maze.
